<p>A few months ago, I was on twitter and saw that sickle cell had been trending. As a person with sickle cell, I was naturally curious to see what it was all about, and I was met with dozens of tweets by other sickle cell warriors, expressing their outrage over a video posted on youtube. I went to check it out so I could understand why they were so upset. It was one of those videos where a group sit down and discuss questions relating to various topics. One question that came up was “would you start a relationship with a person who has sickle cell?”. The members of the group that spoke up said they they wouldn't and gave their reasons. Reasons such as “I wouldn't want my future children to suffer from sickle cell” or “witnessing my partner suffering would take a toll on my mental health”. These are completely genuine concerns, and I also understood them upon hearing them, but at the same time I was upset.</p>

These are completely genuine concerns, and I also understood them upon hearing them, but at the same time I was upset.</p>

<p>I didn't want to feel outrage on a personal level when I knew that they made some valid points, however. I turned to some of my friends, who also suffer from sickle cell, to ask for their opinions on what had been said. One told me that they understand how those people feel, and that it was better they came out  said it now, rather than have a person with sickle cell suffer because their partner neglected them. Another told me “while people are within their right to date who they want to, it's as if they've never researched about sickle cell”. He also highlighted the fact  that sickle cell is different for different people, and it shouldn't be up to us to educate the world on that. One woman in the video mentioned that one of her cousins has sickle cell. We all found that irritating, not because we assumed it wasn't true, but because it made every comment she made subsequently sound more valid, when at times they were disrespectful or incorrect.</p>

<p>I've come to realise, the opinion that people with sickle cell should not have children is not unpopular among the community. Just today I came across a campaign on instagram encouraging people to say no to relationships that may result in a child being born with sickle cell, with the hashtag “#knowyourgenotype” under it. I personally believe it is important for all people, especially black people, who are more likely to be carriers of the sickle allele, to know what their genotype is. In the summer I partook in a debate with other young people who have sickle cell, over whether carriers should be allowed to have children. One person very passionately expressed how we shouldn't, as they wouldn't wish the experience of having sickle cell on anybody. Another person I know said that they've stopped dating other black people for the same reason. I found myself in a situation where I completely understood where they were coming from and why, but I found it hard to agree with their proposed courses of action.</p>

<p>Taking great measures to try and stop  children being born with sickle cell can have terrible consequences in my opinion. However hard we try, people with sickle cell are inevitably going to be born, whether it's discouraged or even illegal, only there will be fewer. While this initially sounds like a good thing, it also means that those few people with sickle cell could be subject to medical discrimination. They would also find it much harder to find support or guidance. It would take forever to find treatments or cures for sickle cell, as it wouldn't be seen as a priority. Trying to erase a group of people who are already underrepresented will just make their suffering worse.</p>

<p>Thinking back to what my friend said, people really need to be educated on sickle cell. Not just the biology, but the ways in which it can affect our lives. The people in the discussion video were all black women, and I believe that their ignorant comments don't reflect who they are as people, rather the lack of representation and awareness of sickle cell. Black people are generally the most aware of sickle cell, as it predominantly effects people of African descent , yet most people still don't know enough about it. They don't know about the various treatments that have been coming about recently, or the extent of the actual symptoms of sickle cell. While I cannot propose a specific solution to these problems, I think starting the conversation is a good first step to take towards finding one.</p>
