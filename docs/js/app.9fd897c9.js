This article will resultantly be incomplete, with a comprehensive recap of events only being possible after the fact.</p><p>There is currently international fear in Europe and America of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine. This is not unprecedented. To understand the situation today, the history of Russian conflict with Ukraine must be understood.</p><p>Russian interest in Ukraine can be summarised as strategic and economic.</p><p>Strategically, they want to stop Ukraine from joining NATO or the EU, to keep the West at arm\'s length. Until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine was part of Russia. In 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed as an alliance treaty, and as a counterweight to the West\'s NATO, formed in 1949.</p><img src=\'/img/ussr-map.jpeg\'><p>Since the Soviet Union\'s collapse, many former members of the Warsaw Pact except for Russia and Ukraine have joined NATO and/or the EU: Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia, Albania and Romania. Russia has watched as the West have marched steadily closer. Not only are they suspicious of the West, but their geography to the West offers little natural defence. The North European Plain is a flat area that covers much of Europe and extends into Russia. There are no mountains to offer protection, leaving Russia exposed, emphasising their desire for Ukraine to stay out of NATO at all costs to act as a buffer between them and the west.</p><p>Sevastopol is a port in Crimea, Ukraine. It is Russia\'s most important port, as it is the only one that does not freeze over for months on end. This is the economic factor. Trade is crucial for economic growth, and trade by sea is a major advantage that countries with large coastlines capitalise on. Russia\'s cold climate limits their use of their own ports, however, leaving them somewhat reliant on the Ukrainian warm-water port in Sevastopol that they have a lease on. They annexed Crimea in 2014, because of this economic reliance.</p><p>Crimea used to be part of Russia and was given to Ukraine while they were both part of the Soviet Union, and it was thought they would forever be linked.</p><p>There is, as mentioned, precedent for a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has said he has no intention of invading, citing American military presence in Ukraine as the real destabilising factor, rather than his moving of his troops to his own border with Ukraine. His word has proven, however, to be untrustworthy.</p><h5>Timeline of Events</h5><ul><li>10th November 2021- The US reports unusual movement of Russian troops near the Ukranian border</li><li>28th November 2021- Ukraine reports a build-up of 92,000 Russian troops</li><li>17th December 2021- Putin proposes a prohibition on Ukraine ever joining NATO, which is rejected</li><li>17th January-10th February 2022- Military exercises from Russia increase and expand into Belarus, while the US gives 200 million dollars to Ukraine\'s security aid and NATO puts its troops on standby</li><li>17th February 2022- fighting escalates in pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine</li><li>22nd February 2022- Russian president Vladimir Putin announced that Russia recognizes the independence of two pro-Russian breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. This leads to a first round of economic sanctions from NATO countries.</li><li>24th February 2022- Russia starts its invasion of Ukraine</li></ul><h5>Analysis</h5><img src=\'/img/truck1.png\'><p>As mentioned, to understand the current situation, the history of Russo-Ukranian relations must be understood. Viktor Yanukovych, President of Ukraine from 2010-2014, initially had good relations with Russia, given his promise that Ukraine would remain a “European, non-aligned state”, in reference to NATO membership, in 2010. However, in May 2011, Yanukovych said he would strive for Ukraine to join the EU, which The Economist said led to him being seen as a “traitor” in Moscow.</p><p>In November 2013, Euromaidan protests began, in which Ukranian citizens demanded stronger integration with the EU. This was the extension of a smaller protest that had happened on the 21st of November, when Yanukovych abruptly changed his mind on an Association Agreement with the European Union, deciding to strengthen economic ties with Russia instead.</p><p>What happened was Russia saw Ukraine was about to join the EU, and so made an offer to the Ukranian President which he accepted, causing him to scramble out of the EU deal, leading to the mentioned protests which eventually overthrew him.</p><img src=\'/img/revolution1.png\'><p>Many protests and demonstrations followed across the country, culminating in anti-Russian factions taking over the government. President Putin would not allow this and given the existence of the valuable port of Sevastopol, he annexed Crimea in February and March 2014. In a speech about the annexation, Putin said “Russia found itself in a position it could not retreat from. If you compress a spring all the way to its limit, it will snap back hard. You must always remember this,” in which he is referencing the eastward movement of NATO.</p><p>There is a clear parallel between the events of 2014 and the events of today.</p><p>Russian troops had been gathering near the Ukranian border since March 2021, moving large quantities of arms and equipment into occupied Crimea. By the 9th of April, the Ukranian border guard estimated that 85,000 Russian troops were in Crimea. This caused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to urge NATO members to speed up Ukraine\'s request for membership.</p><p>Before he invaded in February, President Putin said that the enlargement of NATO was a threat to his country, and as mentioned in the timeline of events, on the 17th of December 2021, Putin proposed a prohibition on Ukraine ever joining NATO, which was rejected. The perceptible chain of events is Ukraine diplomatically moves closer to the west, and Russia exercises military action. This describes the events of both 2014 and February of this year.</p><p>There is a clear conflict between what Ukraine wants and what Russia wants. As seen in the Euromaidan protests, there is a substantial number of Ukrainians who want to join the EU, and there is currently a pro-Western Ukrainian government. This is inconsequential to Russia. Ukraine remaining at least neutral is in their best interest, and so that is what they strive to maintain.</p><p>NATO is a military alliance: if one country is attacked, they all are, and they will all respond. It is for this reason that, while Putin\'s request that Ukraine be barred from joining has been denied, Ukraine has still not achieved membership yet. The current members of NATO know that if Ukraine were attacked and they all had to respond, it would result in a war. Therefore, they keep Ukraine out, they do not send troops, and instead offer indirect support, such as the US giving 200 million dollars to Ukraine\'s security aid and NATO countries putting economic sanctions on Russia.  Above all else, the west wants to avoid direct conflict with Russia.</p><p>Ultimately, the gradual eastern progression of the west is undeniable, and Putin\'s worry and distrust is not unfounded. He complains that Russia has lost 40% of its land, in which he references the loss of land after the fall of the Soviet Union. While the USSR was far from a force for good, and many of the territories that were lost are now better off with their independence, it is still true that Russia is weaker as a result. However, he is attacking an independent country for exercising their autonomy and seeking defence, which they clearly need given the fact that this is Russia\'s second invasion. The west, on the other hand, completely ignores Russia\'s concerns while simultaneously offering little to no support to Ukraine, who are suffering due to their desire to be allied with them. While it may be true that direct conflict or Ukraine\'s membership of NATO would trigger a war (Vladimir Putin has essentially promised that it would), the west remains unhelpful in Ukraine\'s time of need.</p>"},{"Title":"News","Description":"So this could maybe be like the article summed up in a sentance or 2, or just the first sentance of the article etc.","Author":"Author goes here","ImageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Image_created_with_a_mobile_phone.png/1200px-Image_created_with_a_mobile_phone.png","ArticleHTML":"<p>Hello</p>"},{"Title":"News","Description":"So this could maybe be like the article summed up in a sentance or 2, or just the first sentance of the article etc.","Author":"Author goes here","ImageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Image_created_with_a_mobile_phone.png/1200px-Image_created_with_a_mobile_phone.png","ArticleHTML":"<p>Hello</p>"},{"Title":"News","Description":"So this could maybe be like the article summed up in a sentance or 2, or just the first sentance of the article etc.","Author":"Author goes here","ImageURL":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Image_created_with_a_mobile_phone.png/1200px-Image_created_with_a_mobile_phone.png","ArticleHTML":"<p>Hello</p>"}]}'),P={components:{ArticleCard:O},data(){return{AllArticles:j.Z}}};const S=(0,u.Z)(P,[["render",v]]);var E=S;const H={class:"container mx-auto text-left p-5 md:outline md:outline-1 md:outline-gray-300 mb-5"},L={class:"text-3xl my-2 sm:my-5 text-center md:text-left"},I=["innerHTML"];function M(e,t,i,n,o,r){return(0,a.wg)(),(0,a.iD)("div",H,[(0,a._)("h3",L,(0,y.zw)(i.Title),1),(0,a._)("div",{innerHTML:i.HTML,class:"article-body"},null,8,I)])}var W={props:["Title","HTML"]};const C=(0,u.Z)(W,[["render",M]]);var D=C;const F=[{path:"/",name:"home",component:E},{path:"/article",name:"article",component:D,props:!0}],z=(0,w.p7)({history:(0,w.PO)("/"),routes:F});var Z=z;(0,n.ri)(m).use(Z).mount("#app")}},t={};function i(n){var a=t[n];if(void 0!==a)return a.exports;var o=t[n]={exports:{}};return e[n](o,o.exports,i),o.exports}i.m=e,function(){var e=[];i.O=function(t,n,a,o){if(!n){var r=1/0;for(c=0;c<e.length;c++){n=e[c][0],a=e[c][1],o=e[c][2];for(var s=!0,l=0;l<n.length;l++)(!1&o||r>=o)&&Object.keys(i.O).every((function(e){return i.O[e](n[l])}))?n.splice(l--,1):(s=!1,o<r&&(r=o));if(s){e.splice(c--,1);var h=a();void 0!==h&&(t=h)}}return t}o=o||0;for(var c=e.length;c>0&&e[c-1][2]>o;c--)e[c]=e[c-1];e[c]=[n,a,o]}}(),function(){i.n=function(e){var t=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e["default"]}:function(){return e};return i.d(t,{a:t}),t}}(),function(){i.d=function(e,t){for(var n in t)i.o(t,n)&&!i.o(e,n)&&Object.defineProperty(e,n,{enumerable:!0,get:t[n]})}}(),function(){i.g=function(){if("object"===typeof globalThis)return globalThis;try{return this||new Function("return this")()}catch(e){if("object"===typeof window)return window}}()}(),function(){i.o=function(e,t){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,t)}}(),function(){var e={143:0};i.O.j=function(t){return 0===e[t]};var t=function(t,n){var a,o,r=n[0],s=n[1],l=n[2],h=0;if(r.some((function(t){return 0!==e[t]}))){for(a in s)i.o(s,a)&&(i.m[a]=s[a]);if(l)var c=l(i)}for(t&&t(n);h<r.length;h++)o=r[h],i.o(e,o)&&e[o]&&e[o][0](),e[o]=0;return i.O(c)},n=self["webpackChunkschool_newspaper"]=self["webpackChunkschool_newspaper"]||[];n.forEach(t.bind(null,0)),n.push=t.bind(null,n.push.bind(n))}();var n=i.O(void 0,[998],(function(){return i(8952)}));n=i.O(n)})();
