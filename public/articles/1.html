<p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine is ongoing. This article will resultantly be incomplete, with a comprehensive recap of
    events only being possible after the fact.</p>
<p>There is currently international fear in Europe and America of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This is not
    unprecedented. To understand the situation today, the history of Russian conflict with Ukraine must be understood.
</p>
<p>Russian interest in Ukraine can be summarised as strategic and economic.</p>
<p>Strategically, they want to stop Ukraine from joining NATO or the EU, to keep the West at arm's length. Until the
    collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine was part of Russia. In 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed as an alliance
    treaty, and as a counterweight to the West's NATO, formed in 1949.</p>

<p>Since the Soviet Union's collapse, many former members of the Warsaw Pact except for Russia and Ukraine have joined
    NATO and/or the EU: Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia, Albania and
    Romania. Russia has watched as the West have marched steadily closer. Not only are they suspicious of the West, but
    their geography to the West offers little natural defence. The North European Plain is a flat area that covers much
    of Europe and extends into Russia. There are no mountains to offer protection, leaving Russia exposed, emphasising
    their desire for Ukraine to stay out of NATO at all costs to act as a buffer between them and the west.</p>
<p>Sevastopol is a port in Crimea, Ukraine. It is Russia's most important port, as it is the only one that does not
    freeze over for months on end. This is the economic factor. Trade is crucial for economic growth, and trade by sea
    is a major advantage that countries with large coastlines capitalise on. Russia's cold climate limits their use of
    their own ports, however, leaving them somewhat reliant on the Ukrainian warm-water port in Sevastopol that they
    have a lease on. They annexed Crimea in 2014, because of this economic reliance.</p>
<p>Crimea used to be part of Russia and was given to Ukraine while they were both part of the Soviet Union, and it was
    thought they would forever be linked.</p>
<p>There is, as mentioned, precedent for a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has said he has no intention of
    invading, citing American military presence in Ukraine as the real destabilising factor, rather than his moving of
    his troops to his own border with Ukraine. His word has proven, however, to be untrustworthy.</p>

<h5>Analysis</h5>

<p>As mentioned, to understand the current situation, the history of Russo-Ukranian relations must be understood. Viktor
    Yanukovych, President of Ukraine from 2010-2014, initially had good relations with Russia, given his promise that
    Ukraine would remain a “European, non-aligned state”, in reference to NATO membership, in 2010. However, in May
    2011, Yanukovych said he would strive for Ukraine to join the EU, which The Economist said led to him being seen as
    a “traitor” in Moscow.</p>
<p>In November 2013, Euromaidan protests began, in which Ukranian citizens demanded stronger integration with the EU.
    This was the extension of a smaller protest that had happened on the 21st of November, when Yanukovych abruptly
    changed his mind on an Association Agreement with the European Union, deciding to strengthen economic ties with
    Russia instead.</p>
<p>What happened was Russia saw Ukraine was about to join the EU, and so made an offer to the Ukranian President which
    he accepted, causing him to scramble out of the EU deal, leading to the mentioned protests which eventually
    overthrew him.</p>
<img src='/img/revolution1.png'>
<p>Many protests and demonstrations followed across the country, culminating in anti-Russian factions taking over the
    government. President Putin would not allow this and given the existence of the valuable port of Sevastopol, he
    annexed Crimea in February and March 2014. In a speech about the annexation, Putin said “Russia found itself in a
    position it could not retreat from. If you compress a spring all the way to its limit, it will snap back hard. You
    must always remember this,” in which he is referencing the eastward movement of NATO.</p>
<p>There is a clear parallel between the events of 2014 and the events of today.</p>
<p>Russian troops had been gathering near the Ukranian border since March 2021, moving large quantities of arms and
    equipment into occupied Crimea. By the 9th of April, the Ukranian border guard estimated that 85,000 Russian troops
    were in Crimea. This caused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to urge NATO members to speed up Ukraine's
    request for membership.</p>
<p>Before he invaded in February, President Putin said that the enlargement of NATO was a threat to his country, and as
    mentioned in the timeline of events, on the 17th of December 2021, Putin proposed a prohibition on Ukraine ever
    joining NATO, which was rejected. The perceptible chain of events is Ukraine diplomatically moves closer to the
    west, and Russia exercises military action. This describes the events of both 2014 and February of this year.</p>
<p>There is a clear conflict between what Ukraine wants and what Russia wants. As seen in the Euromaidan protests, there
    is a substantial number of Ukrainians who want to join the EU, and there is currently a pro-Western Ukrainian
    government. This is inconsequential to Russia. Ukraine remaining at least neutral is in their best interest, and so
    that is what they strive to maintain.</p>
<p>NATO is a military alliance: if one country is attacked, they all are, and they will all respond. It is for this
    reason that, while Putin's request that Ukraine be barred from joining has been denied, Ukraine has still not
    achieved membership yet. The current members of NATO know that if Ukraine were attacked and they all had to respond,
    it would result in a war. Therefore, they keep Ukraine out, they do not send troops, and instead offer indirect
    support, such as the US giving 200 million dollars to Ukraine's security aid and NATO countries putting economic
    sanctions on Russia. Above all else, the west wants to avoid direct conflict with Russia.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the gradual eastern progression of the west is undeniable, and Putin's worry and distrust is not
    unfounded. He complains that Russia has lost 40% of its land, in which he references the loss of land after the fall
    of the Soviet Union. While the USSR was far from a force for good, and many of the territories that were lost are
    now better off with their independence, it is still true that Russia is weaker as a result. However, he is attacking
    an independent country for exercising their autonomy and seeking defence, which they clearly need given the fact
    that this is Russia's second invasion. The west, on the other hand, completely ignores Russia's concerns while
    simultaneously offering little to no support to Ukraine, who are suffering due to their desire to be allied with
    them. While it may be true that direct conflict or Ukraine's membership of NATO would trigger a war (Vladimir Putin
    has essentially promised that it would), the west remains unhelpful in Ukraine's time of need.</p>
