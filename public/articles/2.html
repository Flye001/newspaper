<p>Well, what are grades? Grades put simply are a place value, they are something that when isolated have little to no meaning but when coupled along with an area of knowledge or intellect, it transforms into the holy grail, the crown jewels, the be-all and end-all. Grades are assigned to every student in the country, even in the world and this is just the standard we have come to expect. But are they right, do they even effectively serve their purpose?</p>

<p>The English system of grading GCSEs was recently adjusted from letters to numbers in 2017. The reason behind this significant shift was to allow for 'greater differentiation' at the higher spectrum of the grading system. This essentially means that they needed to create more categories at the higher end of grades and they realised that they cannot add on letters without just adding on stars to the A grade boundary which would not only be clunky and messy but also would potentially create a greater margin for error and less distinguishable categories. So, the conscious decision to switch to numbers was made which means now that in case of future reform it makes it way more convenient to add another grade '10' for example than A*** which would be its technical equivalent. This switch suggests that the grading system is actively being adjusted and reviewed to ensure it functions correctly, so maybe grades are a good measure.</p>

<p>Although, maybe not. Grades are the metric given but how are these metrics decided, based on tests and exams. Tests and exams are a stressful time for many and this actively affects people's performance as a result affecting their grades. Students often suffer from anxiety, nerves, stress, memory wipe, or even an accumulation of multiple of these factors and ultimately it means that almost every student is unable to perform 100%. So if people's grades are not a representation of them performing at 100%, how can they be a completely accurate measure of a student's intelligence?</p>

<p>They can't. Furthermore, intelligence is more of an abstract concept meaning that it is unquantifiable yet we try to do so anyway. Intelligence does not always have to be an academic quality, it can be either physical or written, thought or done. But grades do not tell you that full story, a construction worker may have way more life knowledge and intellect than a university graduate but because a university graduate will achieve a first, people will accredit them more than a construction worker. What about topics not taught in school like taxes or loans preparing people for life in the real outside world, do they not contribute to the characteristic of intelligence?</p>

<p>So if grades aren't an accurate measure of intelligence why do we use them? Well, because they are the best out of all the other options. There needs to be a way to judge comprehension and currently, there are no better alternatives. A famous quote from Winston Churchill seems fitting right about now “Democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others” and this seems to be the case for intelligence. Moreover, the system would rather utilise a system they know is incompetent and inefficient than adjust to a different system or adjust to no system and create a new format. Why? As the system is more dedicated to itself than the people it serves, meaning that the system is more suited to following precedent and tradition than making a change that benefits the people that rely on the system. How do I know this, well look at how the whole education system functions and explain to me how it serves the students? For example, studies show that young adolescents and adults are more nocturnal meaning that their tendencies tend to them to stay up later at night and sleep in for longer into the day yet, schools still start at 8:30. Ultimately, the whole system is flawed but this is an argument for another day and for now grades do remain the barometers of acceptance and will probably continue to be for a long time, so maybe students just simply must accept it and adapt rather than blame the system that has no alternative.</p>
