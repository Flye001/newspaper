<p>Many are still unaware as to what the sickle cell disease even is. Not to worry as this article will educate you on what it is, and the progression made in terms of the treatment for it.</p>

<h5>What is sickle cell?</h5>

<p>Sickle cell is an inherited blood disease where red blood cells that are meant to be biconcave and flexible are shaped like a sickle and are more rigid. This means they get stuck easily between blood vessels, which slows blood flow throughout the body and causes excruciating pain. As there is restricted blood flow, there is not enough oxygen travelling around the body, so they often feel very tired as a result. The severity of this disease varies meaning some may have very few symptoms and are able to lead a normal life, but others may have to live a very restricted and drug-controlled life.</p>

<h5>Causes and current treatments:</h5>

<p>So, you may wonder, how does someone even get sickle cell? Is it genetic or contagious? It is in fact a genetic disorder caused by a recessive allele meaning even if both parents have the gene, there is only a 25% chance that 1 child will have the condition. In the past, there has not been any definitive treatment that has been proven to be safe and gets rid of the disease. The current treatments include, painkillers, antibiotics, regular blood transfusions and strong medical advice to drink plenty of fluids.</p>

<h5>Stem cell and bone marrow transplants:</h5>

<p>Stem cells are unspecialised cells that have the potential to develop into a cell with a role. These are usually found in the bone marrow of the body. Stem cell treatment firstly involves sourcing and collecting stem cells from the bone marrow of someone who is closely matching the patient. The patient is then given drugs to dissolve their current bone marrow. The donated stem cells are then injected into the veins of the patient which causes the donated bone marrow to replace the patients bone marrow. This new bone marrow then starts to produce new normal shaped red blood cells to oxygen flowing around the body like normal.</p>

<h5>So why not just use stem cell therapy on every sickle cell patient?</h5>

<p>You may think after reading about stem cell transplants that it sounds ideal and like a perfect cure. It is not as simple as it is sounds in theory.</p>

<p>As with any transplant, stem cell and bone marrow transplants pose very big infection risks. Usually before a stem cell transplant, the patient will be given high doses of drugs to weaken the immune system, so the immune system does not kill the stem cells before they specialise. If the dosage is not high enough for the patient, it will cause the transplant to fail and leave the patient in a worse condition than before. If the donated stem cells unfortunately do not match the recipient, the patient will develop graft-versus host disease where the newly injected stem cells will specialise into immune system cells and attack random organs in the body.</p>

<p>Furthermore, approximately 5% of stem cell transplant operations result in death.</p>

<p>Many defer from this treatment also because even if they survive all the above, they may become infertile in the future.  This effect is not caused by the new stem cells but rather because of their high exposure to radiation before the treatment. This damages reproductive organs and many other healthy cells.</p>

<h5>So, is there a solution?</h5>

<p>Scientists have started to work towards gene therapy. Scientists are now gaining more and more information to strive towards hitting the roots of sickle cell disease. Overtime, they have carried out many clinical trials to edit the genome using CRISPRâ€“Cas9. This gene editing technology will counteract the effects of the mutation that leads to sickle cell disease. This potential technology can also be incorporated into current stem cell treatments to increase the chances of it working. An example is haemopoietic (blood components) stem cell transplants.</p>

<h5>Advantages and disadvantages of gene therapy:</h5>

<p>Of course, a known advantage will be a potential permanent cure for the disease because if the genome itself is corrected, then the mutation will have no side effects.</p>

<p>Currently a big disadvantage is that it is very hard to find donors for new bone marrow and stem cells that will directly match the patient and will be able to be used for gene therapy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the development of this treatment is still in its adolescent stages meaning it will be a long time before it can be proven to be safe to use on patients.</p>

<p>A stigma surrounding gene editing is that it essentially goes against some moral principles and some religions may differ from it as it is essentially equivalent to editing yourself to become healthier which in theory sounds like a good thing but many still refuse to believe that this is a positive approach.</p>
