<p>It is an indica-dominant strain with a high THC content and offers the user a sedative experience along with some euphoria. Kush strains are usually hybrid strains, meaning they may make you feel incredibly relaxed, drowsy, and calm. Medicinal marijuana users often choose Kush strains for its pain-relieving properties. Some Kush strains may also make you feel slightly euphoric and focused. Kush is UNSAFE when inhaled. It can cause harmful side effects, such as hallucinations, seizures, heart attacks, stroke, and even death.</p>

<p>This is the new drug that has slowly, but surely decimated communities in Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>Young women selling themselves and teenage boys describing it as the best experience they have ever had - this is Kush, the most addictive drug which seems to have everyone hooked onto the experience. Medical staff in the capital of Freetown say that 90% of the male admissions to the central psychiatric ward are due to Kush use. It isn't just a problem; it's sending youths to the dark.</p>

<p>Sierra Leone remains among the world's poorest countries, ranking 180th out of 187 countries in the Human Development Index in 2011. Decades of economic decline and 11 years of armed conflict had dramatic consequences on the economy. Its GDP per capita also sits at $484, meaning the quality of life is extremely poor and 70% of the population live below the poverty line. Kush is cheap; it's street value compared to the likes of other drugs such as cocaine and heroin is one reason why so many have managed to get their hands onto the drug, as people see it as an alternative to these expensive legal highs.</p>

<p>The drug is essentially plant matter mixed with psychoactive chemicals affecting the mind. It has now become king on the streets, pushing out other more expensive illegal highs like Tramadol as well.</p>

<p>What can be implemented to stop the rise of this drug? The police have been working tirelessly to stop people from taking the drug. They are still battling to win the war against the drug and people selling it. Head of SWATT team at Sierra Leone Police's Transnational Organized Crime Unit, Andrew Ronko told BBC Africa Eye: 'It is wide into the nook and cranny of Sierra Leone, it is not just the city. Tramadol and cocaine aren't even threats. Every other youth in the ghetto have fallen in love with Kush. It is really a threat.'</p>

<p>Those who take Kush say it supposedly takes you to another place, and feelings of depression or dejection quickly subside into feelings of euphoria and ecstasy, leaving the user craving more and more after each hit.</p>

<p>The unrelenting march of Kush threatens to consume the young people of Sierra Leone. The question is now, can Sierra Leone stop the march of this dangerously addictive high?</p>
